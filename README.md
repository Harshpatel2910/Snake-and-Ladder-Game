# Snake-and-Ladder-Game

Hello Everyone me and my friend Harsh Metkel creted this game for our college project.

This is fun Game and more on that we add live scoreboard and dice and player turn.


To make this game more interesting we add three different levels.higher the level the more number of snake are in game that increase the difficulty of the game.

We write code in obejct oriented manner. we use different OOPs method like classes,Function Overloading Encapsulation, etc.
